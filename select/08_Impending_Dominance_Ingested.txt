Born on life support, I can see my glory shining in the distance
They finally rest, all my bravest and best
When I drag my immaculate flesh to the summit

What more can be done? Laid waste to my every rival
Oh so tough when you huff the stench of survival
When will all this end? Just admit I am your idol
Will I cease this? 30 pieces? Upon my revival?

No fucking way
Cut out our tongues and we still won't obey
Ask the betrayed
If your life's in my hand I can clench it away
All will pay
Course you know that routine
Reputation demeaned
Bought yourself some esteem
Gold and green
A plebeian smokescreen
As you prance and you preen
Nothing's stopping this oil-less machine

Should I just fade into legend before I'm revered?
I guess that's what they want when your name invokes fear

Lynch made coffin birth, I was spat into the dirt
Everything I've earned, was exactly what it's worth
My actions concur with the deafening words
Expected to swallow the bullshit you serve

What more can be done? Laid waste to my every rival
Oh so tough when you huff the stench of survival
When will all this end? Just admit I am your idol
Will I cease this? 30 pieces? Upon my revival?

Impending
Dominance
Infamous
Prominence

As I walk on the friends and the foes I have slain
I finally ascend to my throne
Middle digit on the hand of God, the final letter in Man's tombstone
As I walk on the friends and the foes I have slain
I finally ascend to my throne
Middle digit on the hand of God, the final letter in Man's tombstone

Cut out our tongues and we still won't obey
This world's in my hand I can clench it away
